#How to git

**Gotta be in /repos/syslib** (or whatever repo I might create)

```
git status
```
git yer status

```
git add filename
```
add a thing (nothing really will happen)

```
git commit -m "type a comment"
```
commit the git (now something happens and the thing actually gets added)

```
git push origin main
```
finish gittin

---

When I've made edits in the github interface
and I want to sync them:
```
git pull origin main
```
git on in here
