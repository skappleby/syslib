# Creating a Bare Bones OPAC

Notes on the info and processes from this week

_Assignment Week 8_

**Make sure you're in the right directory**

I started by writing the files in my home directory and then the php script couldn't find them. Once I was working in `/var/www/html` where all the other opac-related files were, I was in business.

Also important to remember when pushing/pulling to Github to be in `/repos/syslib`!
