#WordPress Install

Notes on the info and processes from this week

_Assignment Week 10_

I'm installing WP from the [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/) site, 
so I need to check that my versions of PHP and MySQL
are compatible and up to date.

I ran `sudo apt update` when getting started to check for all 
system updates and performed the recommended updates by running 
`sudo apt upgrade`. Then I checked my system versions with:
```
php --version
mysql --version
```
I'm compliant!
