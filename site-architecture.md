# Library Site Architecture

## or: Lessons Learned

_The Final Assignment_

Strangely enough, the systems integration
for the final site architecture went
pretty well! I'd unknowingly already 
kind of set up a workable user interface
on my Wordpress site back when I first
completed the install, so it really was
just a matter of plugging in the right URLs
in the right places, filling out the content
on my Omeka site, and fiddling with some settings
in Koha.

For this final journal entry, I'm focusing 
instead on the things that I learned from 
this last assignment in particular.

1. Creating documentation on processes as you
go is smart and good
	- My journal entries could've been a 
bit more robust in places, but overall I was
_thrilled_ that I wrote down the things that I did.
I'm terrible at documentation and always treat it 
as an afterthought, but it was incredibly helpful
to have done it as I was completing the various 
assignments in class and not have to try to recreate
the steps in my head later. I referred to the notes
in my github journal many times during the last few
projects, and especially this last one.

2. Save passwords safely; do not trust yourself to
remember them later
	- I completely forgot my WP login credentials
which in retrospect was not at all surprising since I
was trying to keep a lot of technical info organized. 
I naively assumed I would just remember later on. 
I did not. Like, at all. And I quickly realized this
wasn't going to be a thing where I request an email to 
do a password reset.
	- Fortunately, I found [WP CLI](https://wp-cli.org/#installing), 
a command line tool for WordPress,
which I was able to install using their documentation
and follow the [Reset Your Password](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/reset-your-password/)
documentation from WP. It was surprisingly easy for the amount
of stress I felt in the lead up! But it would've
been even easier if I'd just recorded my credentials
consistently. Sigh.

3. I can do this!
	- As intimidating as some of this feels,
it's not impossible! I did all of the things I was 
supposed to do, I asked and looked for help when I 
needed it, and the systems worked!
