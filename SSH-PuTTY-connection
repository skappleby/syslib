## Installing a new VM using PuTTY (again)

[This YouTube video is super helpful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmh94mNQHQc)

Open PuTTYgen and click **Generate**
then move the mouse around per the directions
to generate a key pair.

**Key comment:** is actually the user name
we'll use to connect to the VM, so change 
it to something that makes sense in this context.

Click **Save private key** and save
without a passphrase.

Copy the public key text and add it
to the VM instance:
- go to VM instance details and click **Edit**
